# Covid-Detection-using-CT-Scan
I created my own deep learning(CNN) model for early detection of COVID-19 from chest CT-Scan images. As a tool, I have used Keras with Tensorflow background, and the model can be improved by addig more convolution and pooling layers, and increasing the number of feature detectors.
